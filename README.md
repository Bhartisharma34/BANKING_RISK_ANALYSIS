Banks face a constant threat of financial loss from various sources. These risks can lead to significant financial instability, regulatory penalties, and a loss of public trust. The current risk assessment methods are often reactive and based on historical trends, which may not be sufficient to predict future risks accurately. 
The main problem is that banks lack a proactive, data-driven approach to risk management. 
Specifically, they need to: 
1.	Accurately predict credit risk: Identify which loan applicants are most likely to default. This is a critical challenge, as it directly impacts the bank's profitability and stability. 
2.	Detect and prevent fraud: Pinpoint anomalous transactions and patterns that indicate fraudulent activity. Operational risks like fraud can cause significant losses and damage the bank's reputation. 
3.	Optimize portfolio management: Analyze market data to understand and mitigate market risk, ensuring the bank's investment portfolio is resilient to economic downturns.
